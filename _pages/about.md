I'm a PhD student at [QUVA](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/) lab at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com/) and [Andrii Zadaianchuk](https://zadaianchuk.github.io/). 

My current research interests lie in the various *compositionality* manifistations in AI. More precisely, I am interested in **reasoning**, **planning** and **code generation** abilities of LLMs and their applications to **Embodied AI**.

I got my Bachelor's degree from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://eng.mipt.ru/). During my time there, I started working as research assistant at [DeepPavlov.ai](https://deeppavlov.ai/) and participated in the [Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge/2019), which focused on developing chatbots (the pre-ChatGPT era ðŸ˜Š). I earned my Master's degree from [Skoltech](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/), where I conducted research in **Topological Deep Learning** under supervision of [Prof. Evgeny Burnaev](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=pCRdcOwAAAAJ), and continued working on it as a junior researcher at [Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)](https://airi.net/). 

I have a record of publications on conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and EMNLP. Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/), [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024), [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024), [ECCV 2024](https://eccv2024.ecva.net/) and [AISTATS 2024](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/) conferences.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
